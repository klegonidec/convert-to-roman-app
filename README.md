# Decimal to Roman converter

## Context

We want to evaluate the overall quality of your code and your code practices.
The exercise will include a front-end and a back-end side. We don’t expect you to use any
specific framework/library except Node. However, feel free to use any that you may wish.
For the front-end, no work on the design is expected.
Your work will be submitted through Git on the platform of your choice. Each step of the
exercise will be done on a separate branch.
### Aim of the exercise: Convert integer numbers into roman numerals.

#### Step 1:
A front-end form will allow the user to input a integer number between 0 and 100. When
submitting the form, the user will receive the conversion of this number into roman numerals.
So for example, if a user inputs “9” and submits the form, the page should display “IX”.
The actual conversion will be done on the back-end side through an AJAX request.
Conversion rules can be found on the following page:

#### Step 2:
Once your conversion is working well. You will create a second version of the code in which
the result of the conversion is sent to the client through a Sever Side Event.
More information about the SSE can be found on the following page:

## Pre-requisite
You need to have globally available
- Node.js **v16.17.1**
- Yarn _or equivalent_


## Gettings Started

- `yarn` will install dependencies of this project
- `yarn start` will bundle the application and launch it in watch mode using nodemon
- `yarn test` will run tests once. You can launch those in watch mode using `yarn test --watch`
- Using Visual Studio Code, you can launch it in debug with  _[DEBUG] Launch_ 


You can read `GUIDELINE.md` to understand what drived the implementation.
